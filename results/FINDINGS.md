# Spatial-LLM — Findings so far

A neuroscience-inspired spatial encoder (Fourier coordinates, grid cells, place-cell
memory, ViT tiles) fused via gated cross-attention into a LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-1.5B.
Probe task: elevation-threshold classification — *"is this location above the median
elevation (122 m)?"* — on real GeoNames cities, evaluated on held-out cities.

## Headline results — balanced accuracy (3 seeds, ~693–699 val examples)

| setup | location reaches model via | elevation given? | balanced acc |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coord_3d_noleak` | spatial channel only | yes (3rd coord) | **0.983 ± 0.005** |
| `coord_2d_noleak` | spatial channel only | no — must infer | **0.704 ± 0.019** |
| Step 1 `coord_3d` (leaky) | text + channel | yes | 0.974 (1 seed) |
| Step 1 `coord_2d` (leaky) | text + channel | no | 0.717 (1 seed) |
| chance | — | — | 0.50 |

## What we learned

1. **The spatial pathway works.** With coordinates removed from the prompt text — so
   location reaches the model *only* through the coord embedder + grid cells — the
   model still solves the task (0.98 when elevation is supplied, 0.70 when it must be
   inferred). The encoder genuinely conveys spatial information to the LLM.

2. **The encoder learned real geography.** Given only lat/lon and *no* elevation
   input (`coord_2d_noleak`), it predicts elevation-above-median at **0.70**, far above
   chance — i.e. it interpolates elevation over location for cities it never saw.

3. **Step 1's 2D-vs-3D gap is real, not a leak artifact.** `coord_2d_noleak` (0.704)
   reproduces the leaky Step-1 `coord_2d` (0.717) almost exactly, and `coord_3d_noleak`
   (0.983) ≈ leaky `coord_3d` (0.974). The gap measures the value of being handed
   elevation directly (3D) versus inferring it from location (2D).

4. **A methodology bug, found and fixed.** The prompt template originally injected
   lat/lon as text, letting the LLM read coordinates and recall elevation from
   pretraining — bypassing the spatial stack entirely (its gates sat at ~0 while
   accuracy was ~0.99). The `coords_in_text=false` mode is required to actually test
   the encoder.

5. **Per-module fusion gating ("synchronization") does not help.** No accuracy gain
   over a single shared gate, and less stable (one seed collapsed to 0.68). Dropped.

6. **Gate magnitude is not a usage read-out.** Fusion gates stayed ~0.002 in every
   run, yet in the no-leak runs that tiny gate carries the entire signal. Judge by
   accuracy, not gate value.

## Navigation cortex: static vs movement — the "harmful → essential" inversion

The neuroscience modules (grid attractor, conjunctive, boundary, theta-gamma,
microcircuits) were ablated on TWO tasks. The verdicts **flip with the task** —
confirming these are a *navigation* system that needs movement and time to be useful.

**Static task** — classify one fixed (lat,lon) into a 100-way grid (`ablation.py`):

| module removed | Δ accuracy | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| grid_attractor | −91.6% | load-bearing |
| boundary | −9.3% | helps |
| cortical_column | +3.7% | mildly harmful |
| lateral_inhibition | +7.1% | harmful |
| conjunctive | +7.1% | **harmful** (no movement → dormant) |
| phase | +7.2% | **harmful** (no movement → dormant) |

**4D navigation task** — integrate a sequence of moves (heading, speed, vertical
velocity) over time *t* → final (x,y,z) (`ablation_trajectory.py`; 3 seeds, T=12,
metric = within-0.15 accuracy, full stack = 95.3%):

| module removed | accuracy | Δ vs full | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| conjunctive | 0.0% | **−95.3%** | **essential** (was +7.1% harmful!) |
| lateral_inhibition | 86.5% | −8.8% | helps (was +7.1% harmful!) |
| grid_attractor | 88.4% | −6.9% | helps |
| theta_gamma | 95.6% | +0.3% | neutral |
| cortical_column | 98.7% | +3.4% | mildly harmful |

**The inversion:** `conjunctive` (head-direction × speed = velocity binding) goes from
+7.1% *harmful* on the static task to **−95.3% essential** on the movement task —
without it the model can't read the moves and fails completely. `lateral_inhibition`
flips the same way; `grid_attractor` (the path integrator) is load-bearing on both.

**Synchronization helps.** Giving each module its own auxiliary target-prediction
signal (aux loss) lifts the full stack 95.3% → 97.9% (err 0.092 → 0.075). This is the
concrete, working form of "synchronize the modules" — each specialises against its own
objective instead of training as one tangled blob.

**Managing complexity — the empirical rule:** match the module set to the task.
Movement modules are dead weight (even harmful) on static tasks and essential on
movement tasks. `theta_gamma` and `cortical_column` aren't needed for *simple* path
integration — making them load-bearing needs order-dependent / long-horizon tasks
(recall a past position, detect a self-crossing loop), the next milestone.

## Caveats / open questions
- The 3D task is near-trivial (threshold one input coordinate); `coord_2d_noleak` is
  the meaningful spatial-reasoning test.
- All results: Qwen2.5-1.5B, 1 epoch, LoRA on q/v, cities15000, single T4.
- Next candidates: harder tasks (distance/bearing between two points), or pushing the
  2D no-leak accuracy (more epochs / larger coord encoder) to find the geography ceiling.
